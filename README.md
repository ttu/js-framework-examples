Different implementations of a simple Sensor application.

> NOTE: These examples are from end of 2016. I do not know how these implementations will match with today's recommendations.

* Smart components

### react-only-container

* Fork of react-only
* Container components
* Stateless functional components
* Switched state sensors array to object with keys
* Use immutability-helper

### redux

* Fork of react-only-container
* Redux
